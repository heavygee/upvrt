# Quick Fix Workflow
# When the user says "quick fix, <description>", follow these steps:

1. Parse and understand the fix request
2. Ask any clarifying questions if needed
3. Make the fix using appropriate tools
4. Commit and push with a descriptive message
5. Deploy changes:
   - For local production: `docker-compose build upvrt && docker-compose restart upvrt`
   - For remote production: Wait for GitHub Actions to publish the image to DockerHub
   
# Important: ALWAYS run the local deployment step after pushing to GitHub
# This ensures the local container at port 7001 is running the same code that was just pushed
   
# Example:
# User: "quick fix, change IntroVRT to IntroVRt on login page"
# Assistant should:
# 1. Locate login.html
# 2. Make the change
# 3. Commit with message "Fix case typo in server name (IntroVRT -> IntroVRt)"
# 4. Push to GitHub
# 5. Rebuild and restart local container immediately
# 6. Wait for GitHub Actions to publish to DockerHub
