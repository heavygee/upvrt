# Quick Fix Workflow
# When the user says "quick fix, <description>", follow these steps:

1. Parse and understand the fix request
2. Ask any clarifying questions if needed
3. Make the fix using appropriate tools
4. Commit and push with a descriptive message
5. Monitor GitHub Actions workflows
6. Deploy changes:
   - For local testing: `docker build -t upvrt-test . && docker-compose restart upvrt`
   - For production: Wait for GitHub Actions to publish the image
   
# Example:
# User: "quick fix, change IntroVRT to IntroVRt on login page"
# Assistant should:
# 1. Locate login.html
# 2. Make the change
# 3. Commit with message "Fix case typo in server name (IntroVRT -> IntroVRt)"
# 4. Push to GitHub
# 5. Monitor workflows
# 6. Rebuild and restart local container for testing
